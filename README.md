# Experiment 1 for Bert and S2V

Scripts for an experiment.

To run the experiment pipeline (as mentioned in section 4.4), we can use the s2v_pipeline.py script. This script will compute the cosine similarity visualization between a specified app screen and a OB text.

To run the S2V experiment referred to in section 5.5, we can use the s2v_experiment.py script. This will produce the output csv result(Experiment-2-AllOB-SGD)-testset.csv which contains the metrics for all applications in our test set.
